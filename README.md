# Image-Segmentation
The main focus of this repository is to share segmentation approach in image dataset.
Due to enormus size of the dataset, I could not upload it here so that its link is shared here.
Due to limitation of computation power the model built on total 100 images, outof which 20 images are kept aside for validation but there is a provision in the code to incerase number of images as required.
